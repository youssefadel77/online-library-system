## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test
```

## Features

1. Full development environment out of the box using `docker` and `docker-compose`
2. Full code coverage unit testing for the main parts using `jest`
3. Provide documentation of API `swagger`
4. Code quality, linting, and naming convention using `eslint` and `prettier`
